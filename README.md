#Use Case: Sum the total price of opportunity line items when a new opportunity line item is added to an opportunity and then update it on the corresponding account record.

## Using subqueries we cant go more than 2 levels hence we cant get Account, Opportunities and OpportunityLineitems all in the same query. Hence, this is one use case where we want to use Maps in Apex. Without Maps this use case cannot be implemented.
